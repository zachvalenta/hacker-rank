# what is this?

* my working through of some Hacker Rank problems
* constraints from Hacker Rank: stdlib restricted to `math`, `os`, `random`, `re`, `sys` + occasional violations of PEP 8 (functions in camel case) and common sense (some solutions take args they don't use because the problems require those args to run inside Hacker Rank's platform)
