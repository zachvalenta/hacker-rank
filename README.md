# what is this?

* my working through of some Hacker Rank problems

# Hacker Rank particularities

* stdlib restricted to `math`, `os`, `random`, `re`, `sys`
* occasional violations of PEP 8 (functions in camel case)
* occasional violations of common sense (unused args in some places because Hacker Rank functions defined with parameters they don't need)
